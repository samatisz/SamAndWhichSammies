# Sam And Which Sammies Online Ordering Application

## Description of the Project

This application is used for a sandwich shop: Sam And Which Sammies. Orders can be taken and processed online so that customers can order sandwiches, drinks and chips with ease. The application makes it easy for the shop owner to receive orders and this will boost sales as more people are able to put in orders.
The product is unfinished but is still being worked on.
